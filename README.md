# About Me

My name is Geoff. I am a nontraditional student and a veteran with a background in logistics and data science. I was born way out in the country in rural Pennsylvania. I am something of a tech nomad. I am a fifth generation American and an Alaska resident, but I am currently finishing my thesis and doing an internship in Omaha. For fun, I like fat tire biking, seeing new places, and going to dance clubs. I listen mainly to industrial music. I competed on the ballroom team at Harvard University. I like trading futures, doing cybersecurity challenges, and exploring cutting edge data science. My research interests focus around zero-day discovery. I own property in Alaska and Nevada, and some of my favorite cities are Denver, Tampa, Chicago, and Austin.

# How I Work Best

I usually like to block time into specific tasks and work on those tasks exclusively during that blocked time. I arrange my workload by deadline, priority, and balance with the aim of optimizing productivity. I think most clearly in quiet environments with large screens, but I also thrive in noisy, fast-paced environments with numerous distractions. I like to get about ten hours of sleep per night, but I can get by on as little as four for weeks at a time. I don’t want to be micromanaged, but I don't want to sit idle either.

# Communication and Collaboration Style

I prefer communication by email. If I've told you a specific time and means to contact me, please contact me within those parameters. On the other hand, if I've told you that you can contact me anytime day or not, feel free to contact me anytime day or night - but if I'm sleeping, please have a reason.

# What I Value

I fundamentally believe in truth and the inherent goodness of the overwhelming majority of people. I believe in scientific progress and the inherent determinism of nature. 

# What I Am Really Good At

I read fast, and I am good at learning large amounts of information quickly. I excel at low-level programming and digging into the internals of core dumps and packet traces with a hex editor and a debugger. My superpower is the ability to intensely concentrate on a single task for an extended period of time. I have a slew of minor certifications and a few that are industry recognized like the RHCSA and Security+. I was accepted to the Toptal top 3% network as a data scientist. I'm almost done with my MS, and I have a 4.0.

# Feedback and Recognition

I like winning awards. I am intensely competitive and have a strong dislike for favoritism, nepotism, and anything else that awards people over their actual abilities and virtues. I don't enjoy undue criticism, but flattery will get you nowhere. If you have constructive criticism, I would appreciate it if you would let me know. 

# Strength and Weakness

My strength is that I am really quite intelligent. My weakness is perhaps that I see intelligence as a commodity.

# A Few More Things about Me

I was voted Most Serious and Most Intellectual in my high school class. I try to work out at least three times per week. I instructed Grok AI to plan my meals over the summer, and while I often ignored its advice, I lost 26 pounds.
